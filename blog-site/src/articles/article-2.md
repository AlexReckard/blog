Ah, Chicago. It's known for a lot, right? The skyline that paints the horizon, the Magnificent Mile that beckons shoppers, the twinkling waters of Lake Michigan, and man, the pizza - legendary stuff! üçï Whether you're into deep-dish or thin crust, the Windy City's pizza scene is as varied as its residents. Let's check out the city's top pizza joints together.

## 1. Lou Malnati's Pizzeria

Lou Malnati's? Yeah, it's not just a pizza place - it's a part of Chicago's soul. These guys have been baking deep-dish goodness since 1971. What's their secret sauce? Well, literally, it's their sauce - a sweet-tangy concoction made from ripe tomatoes. But the real game-changer is their buttery crust. Rich and flaky, it's the ideal bed for toppings. Finished off with a layer of fresh mozzarella, each pizza here is a culinary masterpiece. Kudos to the Malnati family for creating such a legend.

## 2. Pequod's Pizza

Ready for a deep-dish with a twist? Pequod's Pizza has got you covered. The star of the show here is the caramelized crust - a ring of crispy, caramelized cheese that adds a delicious crunch and unique flavor. The cheese of the pizza is melted against a somewhat castiron-esque pan and they use a detacheable handle with it. The server will get out the slices for each person and then set the pan on the table. This ain't your ordinary pizza, and if you're a true pizza connoisseur, it's a must-try.

## 3. Giordano's

Giordano's is yet another legendary name on the Chicago pizza map, known for their epic stuffed pizzas. Imagine a pie stuffed with an eruption of cheese, sauce, and any topping your heart desires - that's Giordano's. The golden, crispy crust encases a gooey, flavorful explosion that requires a fork, a knife, and maybe a post-meal siesta.

## 4. Piece Brewery and Pizzeria

Craving thin crust? Piece Brewery and Pizzeria has got your back. They whip up New Haven-style pizzas with a thin, crisp crust that still manages to maintain a bit of chewiness inside. With a plethora of toppings ranging from traditional to eccentric, you can craft your pizza just how you like it. Oh, and they brew their own beer. Need I say more?

## 5. Coalfire Pizza

Coalfire Pizza offers a Neapolitan twist to the Chicago pizza scene. Their pizzas are baked in a coal oven, giving them a distinct smoky flavor that's hard to find elsewhere. The crust is thin, slightly charred, and carries a subtle crunch. The toppings are fresh and tasteful, making each pizza a balanced culinary artwork. Whether you go for a classic Margherita or one of their creative combos, you're in for a flavorful surprise.

# What's After Pizza?

Of course, Chicago's food scene isn't just about pizza. Hot dogs, Italian beef, fine dining, international cuisines - there's a bit of everything. So, once you've indulged in the pizza paradise, make sure you dive into the city's other tasty offerings. The pizza world in Chicago is wild, diverse, and absolutely mouthwatering. Whether you enjoy deep dish or thin crust, I'm sure you'll find the right pizza for you in this city. So, next time you find yourself in Chicago, make sure to hit up these local spots! üòÄ
